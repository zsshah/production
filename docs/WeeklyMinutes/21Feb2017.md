## Security (Susan)
   * AHM plan has changed from offering training to a longer "office hours" session
   * Earlier we were planning to give a training in the morning for one and half hour and then one and half hour office hours session in the afternoon to answer the questions
   * Now, we are extending the office hours to 3 hours
   * We had sent the surveys and asked the topics on which they want to learn more. And we got multiple responses for multiple topics, so to cover all of their questions/concerns, we have decided not to focus on a single topic for training

## Communication (Kyle)
   * Chris Cox article posted - https://www.opensciencegrid.org/for-neuroscientist-chris-cox-the-osg-helps-process-mountains-of-data/
