## Release (Tim T.)
### Release Schedule

## Security (Zalak)
   * AHM plan has changed from offering training to a longer "office hours" session
   * Earlier we were planning to give a training in the morning for one and half hour and then one and half hour office hours session in the afternoon to answer the questions
   * Now, we are extending the office hours to 3 hours 
   * We had sent the surveys and asked which topic they want to learn more? And we got multiple responses for multiple topics, so to cover all of their questions/concerns, we have decided not to focus on a single topic for training   



## Communication (Kyle)
