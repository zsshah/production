   * Need to investigate status of Syracuse resources (largest provider of opportunistic cycles), may be affecting over all opp. use.
   * CMS demand is down, work for winter conferences is completed
   * Production support reports flock jobs are up, over 12k for sustained periods, possible correlated with CMS demand
   * BDII shutdown went unnoticed

## Production Support (Ken)
   
   * Running flock job counts still looking better, never dipped below 10K this week.
   * Progress at getting DUNE set up to run factory pilots at Sheffield, Manchester, and Imperial. 
      * They already accept DIRAC pilots so basic VO setup doesn't need to happen; just factory entires. 
      * Hope to be testing in ITB by week's end.
   * Very low hours for the Fermilab VO and Syracuse the past few days, though total opportunistic jobs are not down.
      * Something to do with switch to containers (Fermilab frontend not yet modified.)
      * Ticket open at https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/33416
