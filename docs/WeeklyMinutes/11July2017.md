## Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * Production Status:
     * USATLAS total production over the past week was quite stable, at the average level of 65-75K running job slots.
     * We got a clarification from Guenter Grein about the change on the ggus side, which caused the synchronization issue. That change has been rolled back now.
     
## FIFE - FabrIc for Frontier Experiments (Tanya) 
  * 21% of all FIFE jobs were running on the OSG during last 2 weeks
  * NOvA 473K wall hours
  * MU2E 282K wall hours
  * GM2  131K wall hours !!!
  * DUNE  82K wall hours
  * DarkSide 61K wall hours
  * CDF 53K wall hours
  * DES 33K wall hours
  * MicroBooNE 11K wall hours
  * LArIAT 3K wall hours

   * No release this cycle
      
## Production Support (Ken)   

   * Monthly highlights
      * Overall hours down to 120M from 133M in May. Difference due mostly to LHC (ALICE -1M, ATLAS -1.5 M, CMS -11.5M)
      * 2,000 CPU hours from GlueX at multiple sites
      * OSG VO nearly flat (slight decrease)
   * FNAL and CERN resolved networking issues for protoDUNE jobs on CERN Tier0
   * Working to get new HTCondor CE set up for NOvA use
   * Received inquiry from LSST-DESC about computing resources in Europe (mostly EGI sites.) Waiting to hear from them on what site(s) they're targeting, and then move to act as a broker.
